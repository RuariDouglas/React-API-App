// It's important to always either declare an initial state variable or pass in a value directly into the reduce function as a parameter. REMEMBER - if you want to map over this state, ensure the initial value of that property is an empty array otherwise it will return an error.
// The isLoading property is how we will choose to render certain elements after they load. By toggling truthy and falsey values we are able to say "If isLoading = false; So if we have finished loading, then do something. And vice versa for the truthy value"
