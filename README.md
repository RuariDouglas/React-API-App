# REACT GAMING-API APP

Gaming application which retrieves information from the RAWG API about upcoming and previous titles.

## Functionality

Browse through the pre-populated titles from upcoming, popular and exisiting games or use the search feature to return a list of games. Clicking on any of the titles will bring up a list of game specific information such as: Which platforms the game will be available on, the rating (presented as stars) given on the RAWG database, screenshots and a description of the game.

### About the Build

This app was created to familiarise myself with Redux and how to make API calls from a React app.

These are some of the concepts I employed in this build:

- Redux fundamentals such as creating a store, modifying state & dispatching actions.
- Importing and exporting Actions & Reducers.
- Incorporating and using Redux Dev tools for debugging.
- Using 'THUNK' as a middleware to allow for Asynchronus API calls to be made in Action creators.
